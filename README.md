# QR Code Generator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based QR code generator that allows users to create customizable QR codes. The QR codes can encode URLs, text, or other data, and are saved as image files for easy sharing and use.

## Features
- Customizable QR code size and error correction levels.
- Support for specifying colors for the QR code and its background.
- Automatically adjusts the QR code size to fit the input data.
- Saves the generated QR code as an image file.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- The `qrcode` library
- The `Pillow` library (for image manipulation)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## How It Works
1. The script creates a `QRCode` object with configurable parameters such as:
   - **Version**: Determines the size of the QR code matrix.
   - **Error Correction**: Defines the level of error recovery.
   - **Box Size**: Sets the size of each box in the QR code.
   - **Border**: Specifies the border width.
2. Data to be encoded is added using the `add_data` method.
3. The QR code is generated and styled with custom colors.
4. The resulting QR code is saved as an image file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Update the `add_data` method with the content you want to encode.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python qr_code_generator.py
   ```
4. The generated QR code image will be saved in the current directory with the specified file name.

## Example
The included example generates a QR code that links to a Notion page. The QR code uses red for the dots and blue for the background and is saved as `Ashutosh_Mysql_sheet.png`.

## Customization
- To change the content of the QR code, modify the input to the `add_data` method.
- Adjust the colors by changing the `fill_color` and `back_color` parameters in the `make_image` method.
- Modify the output file name in the `save` method.

## File Structure
- `qr_code_generator.py`: The main script to generate QR codes.
- `Ashutosh_Mysql_sheet.png`: Example output image generated by the script.
